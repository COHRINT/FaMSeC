# `experiment_params` folder
This folder contains (often repetitive) settings for parameters of different experiments. If you want to run a new experiment you need to add a new file (it's probably best to copy one of the existing ones and modify it). The file I ended up using for the v3.0 experiment was `mturk_supplement.jl`.
