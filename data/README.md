# `data` folder
This folder contains data produced while simulating MDPs. Files are saved in the `get_reward_distribution` function in `make_training_data_SQ.jl`, and possibly other places. I don't think these files are actually used anywhere, and are just for safe keeping in case something goes wrong.
