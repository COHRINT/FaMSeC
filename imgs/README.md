# `imgs` folder
This folder is where images of the road networks are stored. These images are "auto sized", and so they may not all have the same aspect ratio.

# `imgs/squared` folder
This folder is where the images from the `imgs` folder are stored after they are "squared", in other words they are forced to have a 1:1 aspect ratio. This is done by running the `svg_resize.jl` script.
